# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage

One of the hardest challenges I have done so far especially trying new interactive elements such as  

- Animating hamburger button to open menu navigation 
- Sliding carousel with JS
- Numerous tricky CSS configuring

This project is incomplete but I am pretty happy with it.
